				<h6>First Indian Satellite. It gave valuable technological know-how about satellites</h6>
				<p>Aryabhata was India's first satellite, named after the famous Indian astronomer. It was completely designed and fabricated in India and launched by a Soviet Kosmos-3M rocket from Kapustin Yar on April 19, 1975. It was built to conduct experiments in X-ray astronomy, aeronomics, and solar physics. It was a 360kg heavy satellite.<br><br>
The spacecraft was a 26-sided polyhedron 1.4 metres (4.6 ft) in diameter. All faces (except the top and bottom) were covered with solar cells.[4] A power failure halted experiments after four days and 60 orbits with all signals from the spacecraft lost after five days of the operation.</p>
